ISE:
on ArchLinux 64bit, we should add following code in setting scripts:

	unset QT_PLUGIN_PATH

or we can't generate ip core normally.

VIVADO:
1. before 2016.3, and on ArchLinux 64bit, we should change the 'uname -i' to 'uname -m' in 'xsetup', and ${INSTALL_DIR}/.xinstall/Vivado_2016.2/xsetup after install.

2. libcurses:
	cd /usr/lib
	sudo cp libncursesw.so.6.0 libncurses.so.5
3. font:
	export _JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=setting'
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Java_Runtime_Environment_fonts

4. license for eth0:
	ip tuntap add dev eth0 mode tap
	ifconfig eth0 up
	ip link set dev eth0 address 66:55:44:33:22:11
5. docnav:
	1) install lib32-libpng12
	2) remove /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2016.3/ids_lite/ISE/lib/lin64/libstdc++.so.6

problem:
1. tcl command 'copy_bd_objs': can't assign name for destination.
2. tcl command 'create_bd_cell': can't assign property when creating cell
3. can't sync configuration of video IPs, in other words, if we wan't to change config, must stop all video IPs.
4. to processing input stream from cmos sensor, all IPs should not consume FIFO before converted to axi stream.
   but all video IPs are axi stream interfaced, so we must convert input to axi stream first, which will waste many FIFO, LUT/FF.
5. the VDMA: what's the object of integrating read/write channel into one IP? Is it for data integrity, i.e. don't read channel being wrote, and don't write channel being read? If so, I think both channel should use same buffer address, which is not implemented by the IP.
